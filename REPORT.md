### CODING CHALLENGE #2: REPORT

During this coding challenge a total of 5 if statements were used unless the else statement counts as well then 6. I was able to combine the 2 if statements given by using the and and or functions as well as every consecutive if statement after that one. To one up my design structure of if statements there has to be a way to combine all the values into one huge if statement but it is difficult to complete it with the proper syntax.
